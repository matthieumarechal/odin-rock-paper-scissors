# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is an exercise from **The Odin Project** curriculum.
The goal is to build a **Rock Paper Scissors** game using JavaScript only, played entirely in the browser console.

The focus of this exercise is to practice core JavaScript fundamentals such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and basic program logic — without any HTML or UI, just console interaction.
